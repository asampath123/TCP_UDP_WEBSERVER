README:

I have created 4 folders 
clientTCP
serverTCP
client_UDP
server_UDP

All in tar.gz format

They all contain a make file

Server will be awake once the persistent requests has been sent. You can send another request of persistence or non-persistence with the server running.

To run a TCP Server:
1. go to ServerTCP
2. make clean, make all
3. ./main.c

To run a TCP Client:
1. go to clientTCP
2. make clean, make all
3. persistent: ./Client localhost 20202 p filelist.txt
4: non-persistent: ./Client localhost 20202 np a.html

To run a UDP Server:
1. go to Server_UDP
2. make clean, make all
3. ./ServerUDP

To run a UDP Client:
1. go to Client_UDP
2. make clean, make all
3. ./ClientUDP 20202 a.html


The port number is 80202 assigned in socket.c and ServerUdp.c. 
If you kill the program you will be asked the change the portnumber. If the program termintaes the port issue wont come. Sorry for the inconvenience.
